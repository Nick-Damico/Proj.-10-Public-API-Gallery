Instructions : Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.

Use at least 1 of the supplied APIs to grab data from at least 6 items from that API. For example, 6 books on Open Library, or 6 movies from the Open Movie Database. Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles. Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox just as in the Interactive Lightbox project earlier with detailed information about the item.
